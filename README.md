# 100 Days of Go

This is the log for my 100 days of Code using Golang. I will occasionally commit
finished projects here as proof of work. Most days will be a short log to show
proof of work.

### Day 6 (8MAR2021)
Worked on a code kata that I couldn't wrap my head around. I seem to be missing
something in my fundamentals, although I think this is in part due to the time 
when I am trying to code. I need to reverse my schedule. Get up earlier, code 
before work, and then I can fit in any code practice I may want in the evening if
I can. I don't have a lot of attention economy left at this time of night.

### Day 5 (7MAR2021)
Didn't get much done today. Just tried some stuff on my own regarding the card
program. Had to do some homework and offline stuff. Now I gotta go to the airport.
Hoping for more work tomorrow.

### Day 4 (6MAR2021)
This commit is a tiny bit late because I was distracted. But I did code today.
I did more Udemy class and learned a lot more about Structs, Pointers, and Maps.
I managed to figure out how to iterate over a class before the instructor taught
it so that was cool. With each new thing I can see how a Blackjack program could
be built. I've written out the logic for it. I plan to give it a whirl soon.

### Day 3 (5MAR2021)
I did more of my Udemy course (see Day 1 for link). I learned mostly about the
structs data type (Feels like fancy Python dicts tbh but I dig it) and I've
started going over Pointers. That's gonna be a new and intersting one.

### Day 2 (4MAR2021)
I did a couple of Katas from CodeWars.com
I feel more dumb than when I initiall started. 
I don't know enough to always get a solution, but the ones I see always make sense.

### Day 1 (3MAR2021)
Still working through Go Udemy course, found :
https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/lecture/7797306#overview 
Completed up through lesson 31. Still confused about when to use Receivers
