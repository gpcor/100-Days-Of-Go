# 100 Days of Go

This is the log for my 100 days of Code using Golang. I will occasionally commit
finished projects here as proof of work. Most days will be a short log to show
proof of work.

### Day 8 (19MAR21)
I spread my programming practice throughout the day when I'd have breaks at work. 
This seemed to be better than trying to cram my practice in to the last 2 hours
of the day. I struggled really bad with a 6 kyu problem that left me a little
disheartened, but I learned quite a bit from the solutions so I was able to
take that knowledge and apply it to a less complicated problem. I ended the night
with a better understanding of Strings and Bytes and how for loops can iterate
through the characters, as well as UTF-8 encoding (sorta). Tomorrow I want to do
more of my Udemy course since the next section is about interfaces.

### Day 7 (9MAR21)
Another night of code katas, another night of not feeling like I got anywhere.
It sucks when you feel like you're doing good in a tutorial and like things are
clicking, but then you put it into practice (on something like a code kata) and 
it doesn't seem to go as planned. That said, I'm only a week into learning Go and
taking this all seriously, so it's to be expected. No one ever got good in a week.
In the words of Cal Newport from "So Good they Can't Ignore You", you have to have
a Craftman's Mindset if you are going to build any usable career capital. Deliberate
practice and good mental strain are the only path to Mastery.

### Day 6 (8MAR2021)
Worked on a code kata that I couldn't wrap my head around. I seem to be missing
something in my fundamentals, although I think this is in part due to the time 
when I am trying to code. I need to reverse my schedule. Get up earlier, code 
before work, and then I can fit in any code practice I may want in the evening if
I can. I don't have a lot of attention economy left at this time of night.

### Day 5 (7MAR2021)
Didn't get much done today. Just tried some stuff on my own regarding the card
program. Had to do some homework and offline stuff. Now I gotta go to the airport.
Hoping for more work tomorrow.

### Day 4 (6MAR2021)
This commit is a tiny bit late because I was distracted. But I did code today.
I did more Udemy class and learned a lot more about Structs, Pointers, and Maps.
I managed to figure out how to iterate over a class before the instructor taught
it so that was cool. With each new thing I can see how a Blackjack program could
be built. I've written out the logic for it. I plan to give it a whirl soon.

### Day 3 (5MAR2021)
I did more of my Udemy course (see Day 1 for link). I learned mostly about the
structs data type (Feels like fancy Python dicts tbh but I dig it) and I've
started going over Pointers. That's gonna be a new and intersting one.

### Day 2 (4MAR2021)
I did a couple of Katas from CodeWars.com
I feel more dumb than when I initiall started. 
I don't know enough to always get a solution, but the ones I see always make sense.

### Day 1 (3MAR2021)
Still working through Go Udemy course, found :
https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/lecture/7797306#overview 
Completed up through lesson 31. Still confused about when to use Receivers
