6 Kyu - Highest Scoring Word

Function takes in a string of words, need to find highest scoring word in string.
Each letter is worth x points according to it's position in the alphabet.
i.e. a=1, b=2, c=3 and so on. 

Return highest scoring word as string. If two strings are the same value, return
value that comes first. 


Reqs:
1. Map of letters to value.
2. Need to convert the string to a slice of words. Should be able to convert to a 
slice and then split index 0 by spaces right?
3. Need to calculate the value of each string in the slice. 
4. Return index that is the highest value as a string.


I can split the string into a slice of words. Each whole word has an index.
Need to calculate value of each word. First attempt will be a nest for loop.

for index in range of the length of stringSlice 
	for index, value in range of map of letters 
		if strings.Contains(slice index, map index)
			sumValue += the value at that map index 
		fmt.Println(sumValue)

Let's start there and see what we get. Overwriting that sumValue isn't really
gonna work for each instance. I'm pretty sure this is going to just add up the value
of each index together into a single value.
